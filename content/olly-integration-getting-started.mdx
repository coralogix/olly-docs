### Insert your API key and connect

1. When you first arrive at the Olly interface, click the **Coralogix Integration** option in the sidebar menu to open the setup modal. Select **Connect now** to begin the integration process.

    Once connected, Olly begins indexing your organizations data and mapping fields in the background. Olly delivers high quality results from the start, with these processes further improving accuracy over time. 
    

You can now begin interacting with Olly directly through the chat interface. Ask any observability question in natural language, and Olly will scan your logs, metrics, and traces to provide insights, root causes, or recommendations.
