---

The **Members** page allows organization admins to view and manage members, handle invitations and access requests, and control user roles within the organization.

## Invitations and requests

The **Members** view includes dedicated tabs for:

- **Invitations**: Users who were invited but haven’t joined yet.
- **Requests**: Users requesting access to the organization.

Admins can approve, reject, or resend invitations directly from this screen.

## View and manage members

From the Members list, admins can:

- View all organization members.
- See pending invitations and join requests.
- Invite new members to the organization.
- Remove members from the organization.

### Change member roles

Admins can change user roles at any time:

1. Go to **Organization → Members**.
2. Locate the member in the list.
3. Update their role from **Member** to **Admin** (or vice versa).

Role changes take effect immediately.

### Remove members

Admins can remove members from the organization at any time:

1. Go to **Organization → Members**.
2. Locate the member in the list.
3. Select **Actions -> … -> Remove member**.

Once removed:

- The user immediately loses access to the organization.
- Any assigned seat is released and becomes available for reassignment.
- The user can be re-invited later if needed.
