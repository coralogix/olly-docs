title: "Dynamic Tables CSV Export"
---

Dynamic tables allow Olly to return structured results as a table artifact, generated from a natural-language prompt. Olly builds tables dynamically and they can be exported as a CSV for further use. This allows to easily share results or continue analysis outside Olly.

Tables can combine data from multiple sources (for example logs, spans, or metrics) into a single view.

## What is a table artifact?

A table is rendered as an artifact in the conversation:

- It appears inline in the chat as a preview.
- It can be expanded into a full table view.
- It can be exported as a CSV.
- Olly exposes the queries used to build the table.

## How tables are generated

1. Ask a question that implies structured data (for example: *“Show CPU usage by deployment”*).
2. Olly generates one or more queries based on the prompt.
3. Query results are combined and rendered as a table artifact.

Different columns may be backed by different queries or data types.

## Table interactions

The following actions are available:

**From the chat:**

- Expand the table for a full-screen view and extra functionality.
- Download CSV.

**When expanded:**

- Sort columns in ascending or descending order.
- Clear sorting to return to the default order.
- View the column-level query.
- Download CSV.
- Copy the table.
