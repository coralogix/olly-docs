Find answers to the most frequently asked questions about Olly skills.

<Accordion title="Fast mode vs. Focus mode?">
    **Fast mode** is best for quick, scoped questions, like "show the last 50 errors."
    **Focus mode** uses a heavier model and is designed for deeper investigations and unknown-unknown scenarios, such as RCA. It may take longer, but provides more thorough analysis.

<Accordion title="Can I download or export Olly results along with the queries that were executed?">
    Yes. Olly allows you to download the results of the queries it executed directly from the UI.

        - For artifacts (such as tables), you can use the Export button to download the results as CSV.
        - You can also export results from chats and artifacts, including the data Olly generated based on the executed queries.

    This makes it easy to share outputs outside of Olly without requiring recipients to have Olly access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need Olly access to view shared links?">
    Yes - Olly supports two sharing options:
    
    - **Private (default)**: Only you can access the link.
    - **Share with organization**: The link is accessible to members of your Olly organization.

    To open an organization-level shared link, the viewer must:
    - Have access to Olly
    - Be a member of the same Olly organization

    If you need to share results with users who don’t have Olly access, exporting the results (for example, as CSV) is the recommended approach.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Can Olly preserve context or learn from previous investigations?">
    Today, the best way to “teach” Olly about your environment, conventions, or known patterns is by using User Rules in the Olly interface.

    User rules let you:

    - Add guidance specific to your systems or architecture.
    - Capture known behaviors, assumptions, or investigation preferences.
    - Customize how Olly approaches analysis in your environment.

    This helps Olly produce more relevant and consistent answers.
