Find answers to the most frequently asked questions about Olly skills.

<Accordion title="Fast mode vs. Focus mode?">
    Focus mode is smarter and uses a heavier model. It’s ideal for investigations and deeper analysis. Users can expect longer runtimes but more in-depth and accurate answers.

<Accordion title="Can I download or export Olly results along with the queries that were executed?">
    Yes. Olly allows you to download the results of the queries it executed directly from the UI.

        - For artifacts (such as tables), you can use the Export button to download the results as CSV.
        - You can also export results from chats and artifacts, including the data Olly generated based on the executed queries.

    This makes it easy to share outputs outside of Olly without requiring recipients to have Olly access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need Olly access to view shared links?">
    Yes. Shared links require Olly access.
    Only users who have access to Olly can open and view shared Olly links.

    If you need to share results publicly or with users who don’t have Olly access, exporting the results (for example, as CSV) is the recommended approach.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can Olly preserve context or learn from previous investigations?">
    Today, the best way to “teach” Olly about your environment, conventions, or known patterns is by using User Rules in the Olly interface.

    User rules let you:

    - Add guidance specific to your systems or architecture.
    - Capture known behaviors, assumptions, or investigation preferences.
    - Customize how Olly approaches analysis in your environment.

    This helps Olly produce more relevant and consistent answers.
