title: "Coralogix Data Sources"

Olly connects directly to your Coralogix data so it can answer questions about your systems.

Data sources are how you tell Olly which Coralogix teams and environments it is allowed to use.

To learn more about data sources, visit [data sources introduction](https://olly.mintlify.app/content/olly-data-sources-intro).

## Types of data sources

Each data source can be personal or organizational (shared).

### Personal data sources

- Visible and usable only by you (the creator).
- Use your existing Coralogix permissions and policies.
- Ideal if you want to ask Olly about your own Coralogix data without exposing it to others.
- Can be created by any user, subject to the sign-in method and API keys they have.

### Organizational data sources

- Created and managed by organization admins.
- Mirror the permissions and policies associated with the Coralogix API key that the admin used when creating the data source.
- Can be shared with:
    - Everyone in the organization, or
    - Specific users and/or specific integrations (for example, Slack).

Because organizational data sources mirror the creator’s Coralogix permissions, any data available to the creator becomes available to every user or integration that has access to that data source.

## Creating a personal data source

1. Go to **Settings → Data sources**.
2. Select **Add data source → Coralogix**.
3. Choose **Personal**.
4. Choose how Olly should connect to Coralogix:
    - If you signed in with Coralogix:
        - Select a team from the list of teams in your region, or
        - Switch to manual mode and paste a read-only API key.
    - If you signed in with Gmail:
        - Paste a read-only API key for the team you want to query. For personal data sources, you should use a personal API key.
5. Give the data source a name (for example, `My Prod`, `Staging`) and select **Connect**.

## Creating an organizational data source (admins)

1. Go to **Settings → Data sources**.
2. Select **Add data source → Coralogix**.
3. Choose **Organizational**.
4. Paste a team-level API key for the team you want to connect. 
5. Set sharing:
    - Everyone in the organization, or
    - Specific users (you can update this later)
    - Optionally mark the data source as available for Slack (see below).
6. Name the data source (for example, `Production`, `EU Prod`, `Shared Sandbox`) and select **Connect**.

See [required permissions](https://olly.mintlify.app/content/olly-orgs-and-regions) for Coralogix API key.
