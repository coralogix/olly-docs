title: "Create Coralogix Data Sources"
---

Olly connects directly to your Coralogix data so it can answer questions about your systems.

Data sources define which Coralogix teams and environments Olly is allowed to use.

To learn more about data sources, visit [data sources introduction](https://olly.mintlify.app/content/olly-data-sources-intro).

## Creating a private data source

1. Go to **Settings → Data sources**.
2. Select **Add data source → Coralogix**.
3. Choose **Private**.
4. Choose how Olly should connect to Coralogix:
    - If you signed in with Coralogix:
        - Select a team from the list of teams in your region, or
        - Switch to manual mode and paste a read-only API key.
    - If you signed in with Gmail:
        - Paste a read-only API key for the team you want to query. For private data sources, you should use a personal API key.
5. Give the data source a name (for example, `My Prod`, `Staging`) and select **Connect**.

## Creating a shared data source (admins)

1. Go to **Settings → Data sources**.
2. Select **Add data source → Coralogix**.
3. Choose **Shared**.
4. Paste a team-level API key for the team you want to connect. 
5. Set sharing:
    - Everyone in the organization, or
    - Specific users (you can update this later)
    - Optionally mark the data source as available for Slack.
6. Name the data source (for example, `Production`, `EU Prod`, `Shared Sandbox`) and select **Connect**.

<Note>If you don’t have a data source yet, Olly may guide you with a one-time animation, a persistent banner above the chat, a tooltip from the data source icon, or a connect modal after sending a message — all leading to the same setup flow. ![Connect data source domain](./images/connect-data-source.png)</Note>

## Next steps

Once you connect a data source, Olly starts learning from your data. You can immediately begin asking questions in the chat, switch between available data sources from the message box, or add additional private or shared sources as needed.

## Coralogix permissions requirements

The following permissions should be attached individually or as presets to your API key, to access all relevant data in your Olly queries.
