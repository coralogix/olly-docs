title: "Rules"
---

Rules allow you to customize how Olly responds to you by defining personal preferences in plain text. They give Olly additional context about your environment, workflows, and response style, so it can better align with how you work and deliver more accurate, consistent insights across sessions.

They can be used to:

- Control response behavior.
- Provide contextual constraints for investigations or analysis.
- Enforce consistent assumptions across conversations.

Rules ensure your preferences are always applied without needing to repeat them in every conversation.

## Rule types

Olly supports two types of rules:

- **Organization rules**: Apply across the entire organization.
- **User rules**: Apply only to your personal profile.

### Organization rules

Organization rules define guidance that applies to all users in the organization.

Examples:
- “Always prioritize production data over staging.”
- “Use `request_id` as the primary correlation key.”
- “Assume availability SLO is higher priority than latency SLO.”

**How organization rules work**:

- Only **organization admins** can create and edit organization rules.
- Once created, organization rules are **automatically enabled** and stored for all members inside an organization.
- Admins can **disable** a rule without deleting it.
  - When disabled, Olly ignores the rule.
  - The rule remains visible in the management screen for future use.

### User rules

User rules are short, user-defined instructions that Olly applies automatically when generating responses.

Examples:

- “The label ‘application’ in my logs refers to the customer name.”
- “When I ask about ‘chats’, use custom metrics.”
- “Only analyze production environment data.”

**How user rules work**:

- Stored per user profile.
- Automatically enabled once created.
- Can be enabled or disabled by the user at any time without affecting other users.
- Disabled rules are ignored but remain saved.

### Rule precedence

When generating a response, Olly applies rules in the following order: **Organization rules → User rules**.

All applicable rules are merged.

If guidance conflicts:
- Organization rules take precedence.
- User rules are applied afterward, unless they contradict organization-level guidance.

This ensures consistent organization-wide standards while still allowing personal customization.

## Creating a rule

To set up a rule:

1. Go to **Settings → Rules**.
2. Select **+ New rule** under either:
   - User rules  
   - Organization rules (admins only)
3. Enter your rule in plain text.
4. Select **Create**

Your rule will now appear in the **Rules** screen.

## Enabling and disabling rules

Rules can be toggled on or off directly from the **Rules** screen.
This allows temporary adjustments without deleting guidance permanently.

## Editing or deleting rules

To edit or delete the rule, navigate to the rule of interest and select **Actions**.

- Rules can be edited at any time.
- Rules can be deleted if no longer relevant.
- Changes take effect immediately for all future interactions.

## Guardrails & validation

To keep Olly safe and reliable, all rules are validated before being saved.

Each rule is automatically checked for:

- **Inappropriate language**
- **Restricted topics**:
    - Competitors
    - Violence
    - Sexual content
    - Other prohibited subject matter
- **Security risks**:
    - SQL injection
    - Prompt injection
    - Other malicious patterns

If a rule fails validation, it is not be saved and you receive an error message explaining that the rule can’t be added.
