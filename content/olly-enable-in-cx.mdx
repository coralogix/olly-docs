## Enable Olly in Coralogix

You enable Olly for a Coralogix team from the Coralogix UI. This is a team-level setting, so it affects all team members.

## Before you start

You must have permission in Coralogix to update team preferences.

## Enable Olly for your team

1. In Coralogix, go to **Settings** > **Account Preferences**.
2. Under **AI-Powered Capabilities**, turn on the main AI toggle.

## What changes after you enable Olly

After you enable the main AI toggle:

- Olly is allowed to query this team’s Coralogix data when users run queries through an Olly data source that has access to the team.
- The setting applies to the team, so it affects all users in that Coralogix team.

Enabling Olly in Coralogix does not automatically create an Olly data source. Data access in Olly is still controlled by the data sources you configure in Olly.

**Note:** Once a data source is created, consent is no longer checked. If the toggle is disabled afterward, the data source will still remain available.


## Disable Olly

1. Go to **Settings** > **Account Preferences**.
2. Under **AI-Powered Capabilities**, turn off the main AI toggle.
