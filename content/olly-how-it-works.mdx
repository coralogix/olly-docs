title: "How Olly Works"
---

Olly continuously monitors your observability data and interprets your natural language questions in real time. Ask questions like:

- “What’s going on with the payment service?”
- “Why is my app slow today?”
- “Which service is impacting user experience the most?”
- “Why are login errors increasing? How do I fix this problem?”
- “Analyze the request flow between these two services.”
- “Graph CPU usage across the system over the past 6 hours.”
- "What is the root cause of this alert?"

Olly scans your logs, metrics, alerts and traces to uncover patterns, highlight anomalies, and trace problems to their source. It doesn’t just point to symptoms - it offers clear explanations and actionable next steps. 
The result: faster insights, clearer answers, and less time lost to guesswork.

## Access and activation

    - Under **AI-Powered Capabilities**, turn on the main AI toggle.

2. You can join an organization in Olly in two ways:

    - Direct invitation: Someone invites your email address.

## FAQs


<Accordion title="On what data tiers Olly operates?">
    Olly operates on all Coralogix data tiers - High, Medium, and Low. This means Olly can analyze and assist with:

    - **High priority** data: Business-critical telemetries that are fully indexed and available for real-time querying.
    - **Medium priority** data: Monitoring telemetries useful for dashboards, alerts, and trends.
    - **Low priority** data: Compliance or archival telemetries stored with limited query capabilities.

    Olly **does not** operate on telemetries in the **Block tier**, as these  are dropped and not stored in Coralogix.

<Accordion title="Where does Olly query data from?">
    Olly currently accesses data only from the teams archive. It does not query data from the frequent search.
