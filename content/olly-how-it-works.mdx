title: "How Olly Works"
---

Olly continuously monitors your observability data and interprets your natural language questions in real time. Ask questions like:

- “What’s going on with the payment service?”
- “Why is my app slow today?”
- “Which service is impacting user experience the most?”
- “Why are login errors increasing? How do I fix this problem?”
- “Analyze the request flow between these two services.”
- “Graph CPU usage across the system over the past 6 hours.”
- "What is the root cause of this alert?"

Olly scans your logs, metrics, alerts and traces to uncover patterns, highlight anomalies, and trace problems to their source. It doesn’t just point to symptoms - it offers clear explanations and actionable next steps. 
The result: faster insights, clearer answers, and less time lost to guesswork.

**Note:** Olly currently accesses data only from the teams archive. It does not query data from the frequent search.
