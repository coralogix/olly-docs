title: "Fast and Focus Modes"
---

When interacting with Olly, you can choose how Olly answers your questions by selecting a mode before sending your prompt. Each mode is optimized for a different type of task, balancing speed and depth of reasoning.

You can change the mode at any time while chatting with Olly.

## Supported modes

Olly currently supports two modes:

- **Fast mode**: optimized for speed and simplicity.
- **Focus mode**: optimized for deeper reasoning and investigation.

You can choose a mode from the input bar each time you send a prompt, and it takes effect immediately. 

Switching modes is possible at any time during the conversation. This allows you to start fast and switch to deeper analysis only when needed.

## Fast mode

Fast mode is designed for quick responses and lightweight tasks.

- **Model used**: GPT-5 mini
- **Best for**:
    - Simple questions
    - Quick lookups
    - Basic data queries
- **Characteristics**:
    - Very fast response time
    - Simplified reasoning optimized for speed

Use Fast mode when you need a quick answer to simple questions, fast lookups, or basic data queries where speed matters more than deep reasoning.

**Examples**:

- “Show error rate for checkout service in the last hour”
- “What is the current CPU usage of node-3?”
- “List alerts fired in the last 10 minutes”

## Focus mode (default)

Focus mode is Olly’s default and most powerful mode.

- **Model used**: GPT-o3
- **Best for**:
    - Complex investigations
    - Root-cause analysis
    - Exploratory observability questions
- **Characteristics**:
    - Deeper analysis and reasoning
    - Takes longer to respond than Fast mode
    - Uses multiple specialized sub-agents, each acting as an expert in a specific domain (for example, logs agent).

Choose Focus mode for in-depth analysis tasks, such as investigating issues, uncovering root causes, or exploring observability data that require a deeper level of analysis.

**Examples**:

- “Why did latency spike after the last deployment?”
- “Investigate the root cause of intermittent 5xx errors”
- “Correlate error logs with recent infrastructure changes”
