title: "What Olly Can Do"
---

Olly has full access to your observability data and is built to simplify and accelerate your observability workflows. 
You can use it to:

- Receive quick, meaningful insights into logs, metrics, traces and errors
- Identify the root cause of incidents and events
- Generate performance overviews in plain English
- Offer guided recommendations to resolve and prevent issues
- Visualize insights with charts - line, bar, pie, stacked bar, area, horizontal bar, and multi-series bar.
    - Olly selects the most effective type automatically, or generates one on request.
- Provide supporting data views alongside answers:
    - Logs: A raw data table of matching log entries
    - Metrics: A line chart showing returned metric values and labels
    - Spans: A Gantt view of the full trace containing the span
    - Alerts: The logs that triggered the alert

By eliminating manual investigation and surfacing the “why” behind system behavior, Olly helps your team respond with speed and confidence.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="How accurate is Olly?">
    Accuracy is one of Olly’s strongest advantages. In practice, Olly consistently delivers higher-quality answers than any other SRE Agent we’ve seen in the market, and is one of the few solutions that actually delivers on the promise of autonomous observability. Customers experience this as faster, more precise root-cause analysis, fewer hallucinations, and answers that are grounded in real production context rather than generic LLM responses.
    That quality is not accidental. Olly is built around our *Context Engineering Triangle*: a purpose-built agent architecture with multiple specialized (SLM-based) agents, an advanced proprietary knowledge system that deeply understands customer telemetry and environments, and a rigorous agent evaluation system that continuously measures and improves output quality. That said, the most convincing “metric” is hands-on experience.

<Accordion title="What happens if Olly is incorrect?">
    Like any AI-powered system, Olly is not perfect and may occasionally produce incorrect insights, incomplete analyses, or sub-optimal recommendations. It is built with this reality in mind and is designed to support human decision-making rather than silently replace it. Depending on the task and risk level, Olly operates with appropriate guardrails - ranging from advisory suggestions to actions that require human approval and can be reviewed or reversed.
    From both a product and legal standpoint, this possibility is explicitly accounted for. The platform includes transparency, control, and feedback mechanisms to reduce the impact of errors and continuously improve over time, while the legal terms acknowledge the probabilistic nature of AI systems and define clear boundaries and responsibilities accordingly.
