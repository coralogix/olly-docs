### ✨ **Fast Mode**

Introducing **Fast Mode**, a new capability that significantly improves response speed1. Quickly switch between a detailed, slower "focus mode" and a quicker, less in-depth **Fast Mode** to get the insights you need faster2.

- **Note:** You can toggle sharing on or off at any time. Shared chats are view-only for others.

### 🧩 **Artifact Previews**

You can now see artifact previews directly in Olly’s responses - including logs, traces, charts and more - without leaving the chat.

### ✏️ **Message Editing**

Modify your prompts with the new message editing feature4. Editing a prompt replaces the original prompt and response with a new conversation branch5.

### ⚡ **Access to Alerts**

Olly now has access to your Coralogix alerts and incidents, in addition to logs, metrics, and traces. Ask natural questions to get linked answers with context and suggested next steps.

**Try asking:**

- What's my most recent alert?
- What is the root cause of this specific alert?
- Why was an alert triggered at 00:05 on Sunday?
- I see this error. What alert would you suggest I set up to monitor this?
- Give me a list of all of the alerts I have set up for this environment.

### 📋 **Prompt Templates**

Get started faster with ready-made prompt templates. Select a template, and Olly will fill in a suggested prompt you can modify and run. Templates cover common onboarding and troubleshooting flows, helping you move from question to insight more quickly.
