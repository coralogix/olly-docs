### ✨ **Fast Mode**

Olly now supports two powerful modes to match your workflow. **Fast Mode** delivers responses at lightning speed, helping you get quick answers and act instantly when time matters most. For deeper analysis and richer context, switch to **Focus Mode**, which provides detailed, in-depth insights.

Effortlessly toggle between modes to balance speed and depth - get exactly what you need, when you need it.

**Try asking:**

- What's my most recent alert?
- What is the root cause of this specific alert?
- Why was an alert triggered at 00:05 on Sunday?
- I see this error. What alert would you suggest I set up to monitor this?
- Give me a list of all of the alerts I have set up for this environment.

### 📋 **Prompt Templates**

Get started faster with ready-made prompt templates. Select a template, and Olly will fill in a suggested prompt you can modify and run. Templates cover common onboarding and troubleshooting flows, helping you move from question to insight more quickly.
