### 🎉 Olly is now Generally Available (GA)

Olly is production-ready and can be used in day-to-day observability workflows. It is available for all eligible users, with a stable feature set, improved reliability, and ongoing support.

### 🔗 Data sources

[Data sources](https://docs.olly.new/content/olly-data-sources-intro) let you connect Olly to Coralogix data by defining the team, auth method (API key or OAuth), and who can use it.

Why this matters:

- Better, scoped answers: Olly queries only the data you approve

- Control you can scale: Manage access cleanly across teams and environments

### 🔐 Sign in with Coralogix

You can now sign in to Olly using your [Coralogix](https://docs.olly.new/content/olly-orgs-and-regions#continue-with-coralogix) account, with permissions and access fully aligned to Coralogix.

This secure, one-click sign-in:

- Automatically connects Olly to the Coralogix teams and data sources you already have permission to access

- Enforces the same user roles and access controls defined in Coralogix

- Removes the need to manage separate credentials or API keys

The result is a faster, safer setup—making it easy to connect Olly to your data while staying fully aligned with existing security and permission models.

### ⌘ Enhanced Search Functionality

The search experience just got more powerful.

Previously, search results were limited to conversation titles. Now, Ctrl+K (Windows) or Command+K (macOS) searches across the full content of past conversations, including:

- Questions you asked Olly

- Answers and explanations provided by Olly

This makes it much easier to rediscover previous investigations, insights, or troubleshooting steps—without needing to remember exact conversation titles.

### 📱 Mobile Support

Olly is now available on mobile, bringing the same investigation and troubleshooting capabilities to your phone.
You can ask questions, review past conversations, and continue investigations on the go, making it easier to access insights whenever and wherever you need them.
