### Continue with Coralogix

Use this option when you want to sign in using your Coralogix identity and context.

1. Select `Continue with Coralogix`.
2. Complete the Coralogix sign-in flow.
3. Return to Olly.

If you have access to multiple organizations, you’ll be prompted to choose which organization to enter.

Coralogix also affecta which region Olly opens.


### Continue with Google

Use this option to sign in to Olly with your Google account.

1. Select `Continue with Google`.
2. Choose the Google account you want to use.
3. Return to Olly.

If you have access to multiple organizations, you’ll be prompted to choose which organization to enter.

### Sign in with email

Use this option to sign in with an email address.

1. Select `Sign in with email`.
2. Enter your email address and continue.
3. Follow the on-screen steps to complete sign-in.

### Sign up to Olly

Use this option if you don’t have an Olly account yet and your organization allows sign-ups (for example, during onboarding or a proof of concept).

1. Select `Sign up to Olly`.
2. Enter your email address and follow the on-screen steps to create your account.
3. After you finish sign-up, Olly takes you into your organization.

If you can’t sign up or you don’t see your organization after sign-up, contact your Coralogix representative.

## Join an organization

You can join an organization in two ways:

- Direct invitation: someone adds your email address to the organization.
- Domain-based access: your email domain is allowed to join automatically (if enabled for the organization).

On your first sign-in:

- If you have access to only one organization, Olly takes you there automatically.
- If you have access to multiple organizations, Olly asks you to choose which one to enter.

You can switch organizations later from the organization selector in the UI.

## Choose an organization

If you have access to more than one Olly organization:

- On sign-in, you’ll be prompted to choose which organization to enter.
- After you enter an organization, you can switch organizations later from the organization selector.

If you have access to only one organization, Olly takes you there automatically.

## How Olly selects your region at sign-in

After you enter an organization, Olly opens a region workspace using the following order:

1. Last used region
    
    Olly returns you to the region you used most recently within that organization.
    
2. Region from Coralogix sign-in
    
    If you signed in using `Continue with Coralogix`, Olly opens the region that matches your Coralogix sign-in context.
    
3. Organization default region
    
    If neither of the above applies, Olly opens the organization’s default region.
    

If you have access to multiple regions, you can switch regions at any time from the region selector.

## What you can do after you sign in

Once you’re inside an organization:

- You can use any organizational data sources that an admin shared with you.
- You can create your own personal data sources for your own use.
- If you are an Org Admin, you can create and manage organizational data sources for your team.

To create or manage data sources, go to `Settings → Data sources`.

## Connect Coralogix during onboarding

When you choose `Continue with Coralogix` during onboarding, or when you sign in with Coralogix while creating a data source, you go through a Coralogix OAuth flow.

During this flow, Olly requests access to:

- Read data from the Coralogix team or teams you select
- Create or use a Team API key on your behalf (depending on your Coralogix permissions)

After you complete the flow:

- Olly creates a data source (personal or organizational, depending on your choice and role).
- You select the specific Coralogix team to associate with that data source.

For the full set of options (API key vs Coralogix sign-in, personal vs organizational, sharing, and Slack), see the Data sources page.

## Next steps

- If you need to connect Coralogix data, create a data source from `Settings → Data sources`.
- If you landed in the wrong region, switch regions from the region selector in the header or user menu.
